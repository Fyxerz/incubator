	<h2>UX design</h2>
	<dl>
		<dd>
			While still a student, I have worked in several projects hat have helped me stablish a good knowledge of good UX design I believe that the process to good UX is based on three things that should be equally present within the time working on a project. 
		</dd>
		<dt>User research</dt>
		<dd>
			I'm very focused on understanding the audience that the product is destined for. But do we even know who that audience is? Understanding the market, the audience, and the user archetype allows for a tailored product that isn't what the user wants, but what the user needs. 
		</dd>
		<dt>Planning</dt>
		<dd>
			From the user research, I like to condense all the data and filter it to clear out what the different users are and what the app truly needs to be. Normally this translates to User stories, personas, importance charts, and a bunch of post its around my room with details about interactions and problems that the user has with the problem that the app will solve. 
		</dd>
		<dt>Prototyping</dt>
		<dd>
			Depending on the stage of the product I like to vary on the fidelity of the prototypes. From lo-fi hand made prototypes to fully interactive, coded mock apps, it is a great way to find issues with the current UI ideas, or user story concepts.

		</dd>
		<dt>JavaScript</dt>
		<dd>

			I normally work on Mac command line, even though I also know how to work on the Linux command line, as I like to work on ZSH.
		</dd>
		<dt>Sublime Text 3</dt>
		<dd>
			I take care of my text editor skills as... well, it's where you spend most of the time, I learned the different shortcuts and utilities which really help my workflow. (Not to mention the different plugins that are available for the editor.) 
		</dd>
		<dt>Git</dt>
		<dd>
