			 Colorify is a vanilla JavaScript plugin that gets the main color of an image and outputs it in RGB form. 
		</p>
		<p class="project-paragraph">
			 As this is a bit of a vanity project, I haven't advanced it too much, but I would like to add different functionality like: 
		</p>
		<ul class="project_list">
			<li>
				Being able to output the color in Hex format. 
			</li>
			<li>
				 Other target tagging ways so that you can use that color in the best, most efficient way. 
			</li>
			<li>
				 More styling options. 
			</li>
			<li>
				 The option to get more than the dominant color in an image, but also the 2nd or 3rd. 
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="project-paragraph">
			 Apart from adding more functionality, I would also like to prepare a proper GitHub page explaining how the plugin works and I would also like to open source it, so that other people could help improve such a cool thing, which I'm sure a lot of designers can think about really cool things to do with it.
