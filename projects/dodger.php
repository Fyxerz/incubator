			  As an excuse to learn more about pure JavaScript I decided to build a site that didn't require any type of framework or plugin. Apart from this, I wanted to look at different ways of designing UIs and web products. 
		</p>
		<p class="project-paragraph">
			  This led me to want to redesign the website used by YouTuberPressHeartToContinue as I could see that there could be some cool improvements to the UI that would make the website feel more appropriate. 
		</p>
		<p class="project-paragraph">
			 The website's main intro line said "The hub to everything Dodger related", so I decided to build something that felt like a hub, inspired by one of the strongest designs I have seen lately regarding hub based navigation systems, Windows 8's metro display. 
		</p>
		<p class="project-paragraph">
			 With that in mind, I started building the site using only ES6 features, which became a bigger challenge than I expected, having some over engineered solutions to solving some of the problems I was having with the UI. Some of these solutions were also a bit of a miss, as they are built very strongly on JS styling instead of CSS meant that creating a responsive design would require a lot more javascript to build. This is why adding styling with JS should be built using classes and not style. Note taken.
