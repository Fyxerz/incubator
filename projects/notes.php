			   Seeing how MVCs are all the rage lately, I wanted to see what it was all about. I decided to go with angular, as it seems to have quite a big following, and I could find quite a bit of documentation about it. 
		</p>
		<p class="project-paragraph">
			   While I still have a long way to go to be able to call myself an angular developer, it was nice to see how apps work, as well as the importance of having a strong data model (This was the hardest part of actually getting an app that was easy to scale.) 
		</p>
		<p class="project-paragraph">
			  It also was really cool to see how two way data binding worked, and it made me want to learn more about directives and factories. I think I'm gonna need to build a bigger app, to really need those features though. 
		</p>
		<p class="project-paragraph">
			  Apart from that, I also used HTML5 localStorage features, which are pretty cool, and I'm pretty sure they can become very useful in some scenarios.
